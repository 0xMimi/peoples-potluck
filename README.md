# People's Potluck

[peoples-potluck.web.app](https://peoples-potluck.web.app/)

Registered domain on Domain.com: [peoplespotluck.tech](https://peoplespotluck.tech/) (Not fully functionnal yet since security certificate takes time to work. My project needs https to work, so go on previous link)

Also requires Hedera wallet to work

Files that I worked on:
- contracts/nft.sol
- contracts/nft_help.js
- contracts/treasury.sol
- contracts/treasury_help.js
- backend/app.py
- frontend/src/App.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Apply.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Approve.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Donate.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx

contracts/treasury_help.js and contracts/nft_help.js aren't actually part of the app, just helper files during development
