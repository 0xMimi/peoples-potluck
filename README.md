# People's Potluck

[peoplespotluck.tech](https://peoplespotluck.tech/)

Also requires Hedera wallet to work

Files that I worked on:
- contracts/nft.sol
- contracts/nft_help.js
- contracts/treasury.sol
- contracts/treasury_help.js
- backend/app.py
- frontend/src/App.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Apply.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Approve.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Donate.jsx
- frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx

contracts/treasury_help.js and contracts/nft_help.js aren't actually part of the app, just helper files during development
